# COMP-521-Project

A research project for COMP 521 (Modern Computer Games) that explores the various aspects of terrain analysis, artificial intelligence and influence maps in the context of a simplified RTS game (imagine StarCraft if each player was only given a handful of marines).

The influence map visualized on top of the terrain (visualization can be disabled) has red marked as danger and blue marked as safe.

A prototype of this game was created for McGill game jam and was subsequently scrapped and redesigned. You can find that prototype in the Game Jam branch.

The heat map goes from dark blue (super safe/favourable) to white (neutral/no heat) to dark red (super dangerous).
